Hi! 

My full name is [Tobias Heindel](https://keybase.io/heindel). I hold a PhD in computer science. Supervisors, managers, hosts, and the like in chronological order have been: 

Peter Schroeder-Heister (Master's degree),
Barbara KÃ¶nig (PhD supervisor),
Andrea Corradini,
Fabio Gadducci,
Arend Rensink,
Damiano Mazza,
Eric Goubault,
Vincent Danos,
Jakob Grue Simonsen,
Manfred Droste,
Dusko Pavlovic,
Uwe Nestmann, 
Ingo Weber. And now for something completely different. 

I have joined the [Heliax team](https://heliax.dev) to build [Anoma](https://anoma.network/). And we are getting closer!
